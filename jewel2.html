      <p>
        We help applicants in the biological sciences turn early research ideas
        and draft proposals into submissions that stand a real chance of funding
        or interview.

        Why strong candidates still struggle with PhD proposals
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Expectations are rarely made explicit</li>
        <li>Good ideas lack structure and focus</li>
        <li>Proposals don’t align with funding or supervisors</li>
        <li>Feedback is vague, inconsistent, or contradictory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These challenges affect applicants from all backgrounds — not because
        they lack ability, but because proposal writing is an acquired skill.
