<p> Not sure how to get students started </p>


<p>during our last meeting we decided that the direction was at risk of becoming teaching </p>

<p>so i have tried to create the tasks and I guess we tell them to just have at it.</p>

<p>but this concerns me because how do we know that they are going in the right direction / know what to do </p>

<p>i suppose that it can be quite daunting with no prior knowledge.</p>

<p>I could offer regular check-ins and workshops that introduce the ideas in a safe and structured space with a slight time-delay so that they have a chance to try things out for themselves first.</p>

<p>then the sessions can act as clean up to bring students who might not be keeping up back in line with the overall schedule of progress.</p>
