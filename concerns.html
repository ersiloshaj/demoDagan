<p> Not sure how to get students started </p>


<p>during our last meeting we decided that the direction was at risk of becoming <b>pure teaching</b></p>

<p>so i have tried to create the tasks and I guess we tell them to just have at it.</p>

<p>but this concerns me because how do we know that they are going in the right direction / know what to do </p>

<p>i suppose that it can be quite daunting with no prior knowledge.</p>

<p>I could offer regular check-ins and workshops that introduce the ideas in a safe and structured space with a slight time-delay so that they have a chance to try things out for themselves first.</p>

<p>then the sessions can act as clean up to bring students who might not be keeping up back in line with the overall schedule of progress.</p>

<em><b>Potentially,</b> it might still be worth giving everyone the same ultra-basic dataset week 1 and having them work on a very simple dashboard for X amount of time so they can get a feel for the workflows, processes and coding knowledge before needing to face complex and potentially over-whelming datasets.</em>

<p>Are students going to work on personal devices or server, ie do we need to install Shiny on stats3. I also wonder if it functions well from there as have never tried.</p>
<p>Do you have any concerns with the direction this is going in?</p>
<p>Anything you would like to see done before next time?</p>

<p>I feel like the skeleton is close to being formed and enabling me to really start tying it all together in a way that feels natural and fluid.</p>
